Getting Started
----
Install from releases: [releases](https://github.com/bketelsen/slides/releases)

Initialize a New Slide Repository
----
`slides init [reponame]`

```shell
slides init mytalks
cd mytalks
git init
git add --all
```
Then edit anything you want to change in `publish.tmpl` for individual slides and `root.tmpl` for the talk listing page.

`slides init` places the contents of the `slides-template` directory into the `mytalks` directory as a base for your decks.  The web assets in this directory are used to build the HTML files for your slides.

Directory Structure Of a Slide Repository
------
If you ran `slides init mytalks` your directory structure should look like this:

``` 
/mytalks --> repo root
    /public --> output files from `slides build`, published HTML
    /slides --> your slide decks, in Markdown format
    /static --> files used for `slides dev` local server
    /templates --> Go template files for `/public` and `/static`
    /initial-slides.md --> the template file used for `slides new {name}`
```
